        <h1><center>ABOUT BERNESE MOUNTAIN</center></h1>
            <h4>
                Along with chocolate and cheese, the Swiss Canton of Bern is best known as the home of four breeds of mountain dogs, including the Bernese Mountain Dog. They’re striking, powerful, placid, and affectionate, so there’s a lot to love. Here are even more Bernese Mountain Dog facts that will teach you all about this breed.

               <h1> The Breed Is Versatile</h1>
                Bred in an agricultural region of Switzerland, Berners are all-around farm dogs, good at droving, drafting, herding, protecting the farmyard, and being wonderful family companions.
                
                The Breed Hails From Bern
                The Bernese Mountain Dog was developed in Bern, Switzerland, which is where the name came from. They were one of four 
                mountain dogs that helped drive cattle. Milk was important to Switzerland’s biggest exports: chocolate, and cheese, and the Berners played a big role in that.
